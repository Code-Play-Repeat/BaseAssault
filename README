Database for Base Assault Project
----------------------------------

Class database project from CSE 111 Databases.
==============================================

* A simple database to keep track of user information for a mobile app game called Base Assault using sqlite.
* All you need to run the program is java and download the excutable .jar file along with the BasseAssult file from the folder BaseAssault Executable Jar file.
* Make sure that wherever you download the files to, that both files are contained within the same directory.
* In order to view the database files you need sqlite3 and sqlitestudio-2.1.2 or higher version.
* A better view of the gui aspect of the application can be achieved using NetBeans IDE 7.2.1 or higher version.
* An important reminder if using NetBeans, both the .java and .form version of the files are important for viewing properly.
* The .java files contain the code while the .form files contain the gui format and make the gui editable and viewable in NetBeans.
* To view the formatting of the gui, download the files from BaseAssault and open them in NetBeans IDE.
